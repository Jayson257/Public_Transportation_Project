# Public_Transportation_Project

For this project, I attempted to upload different datasets in order to conduct t-tests determining whether public transportation helps improve a community's economic status. I have uploaded datasets that involve New York City's subway data, Washington D.C.'s metro data, and education rates for both cities from the American Community Survery API via the Census Bureau. I conducted my analysis code & visualizations together using a Jupyter Notebook. I have uploaded the project via an HTML file and a IPYNB file, just in case one of the files don't open.
